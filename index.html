A singer, dancer, and performer in her early years, Angelou worked internationally before becoming a writer. 
She was a close friend and associate of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and her work often reflected 
themes of identity, family, racism, and resilience. Later in life, she was celebrated as a powerful voice of 
African American culture and history, with her writings emphasizing strength, dignity, and hope. 
In recognition of her contributions, she was awarded the National Book Award, three Grammy Awards, and the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. Maya Angelou remains an enduring symbol of courage, creativity, and the 
transformative power of words.
